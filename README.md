# Application-of-full-convolution-network-in-lung-segmentation-of-medical-CT-images
---

#### experimental environment: ubuntu 14.04  python2.7  tensorflow 0.12

#### I use the Fully Convolutional neuron network to segement the lung region in CT scans, the CT scans are from LIDC_IDRI dataset. particularlity I used LUNA dataset, which contains 888 cases and the lung mask is giving.

#### the result is pretty impressive, most cases segementation is accuracy, you can check the example result in the repository. I think it is worthing to expolore more models and more datasets, maybe training the model with cases that contain nodules in lung region.

#### if you think it is helpful, please give a star, thinks very much.
